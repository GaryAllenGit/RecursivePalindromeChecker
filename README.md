This is a demo of using recursion, in this case to solve whether a given word is a palindrome or not.

There is:
a RecursivePalindromeSolver class containing the 'isPalindrome' method, 
a class with a main method to animate and test it, 
a JUnit test class to test it more throruhgly, 
and a GUI class to use it interactively.

All have been built in IntelliJ and the IntelliJ project structure is also present.
